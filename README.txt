Testcase 00: The difference between our output and the expected output is the time values for the clock.
Our values are close to the expected values but can be attributed to the difference in devices thus making it
within the bounds of the spec.

Testcase 01: The difference between our output and the expected output is the time values for the clock.
Our values are close to the expected values but can be attributed to the difference in devices thus making it
within the bounds of the spec.

Testcase 06:The difference between our output and the desired output is when child 1 terminates. In our solution child 1
terminates after its writes to the terminal, and the expected output has is terminate before child 2 terminates. 
This differnce is minimal and is not described in the spec and just relates to the schdueling of the termination.

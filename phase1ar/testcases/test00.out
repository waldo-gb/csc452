Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: init() manually switching to PID 1.
phase2_start_service_processes() called -- currently a NOP
phase3_start_service_processes() called -- currently a NOP
phase4_start_service_processes() called -- currently a NOP
phase5_start_service_processes() called -- currently a NOP
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: init() manually switching to testcase_main() after using spork() to create it.
testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: Simple spork()/join() should complete.
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: Manually switching to the recently created XXp1()
XXp1(): started
XXp1(): arg = 'XXp1'
testcase_main(): after spork of child 3
testcase_main(): performing join
testcase_main(): exit status for child 3 is 3
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: testcase_main() returned, simulation will now halt.
finish(): The simulation is now terminating.

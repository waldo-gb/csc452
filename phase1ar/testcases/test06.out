Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: init() manually switching to PID 1.
phase2_start_service_processes() called -- currently a NOP
phase3_start_service_processes() called -- currently a NOP
phase4_start_service_processes() called -- currently a NOP
phase5_start_service_processes() called -- currently a NOP
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: init() manually switching to testcase_main() after using spork() to create it.
testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: Create XXp1 (moderate priority); that creates 2 XXp2 children (low priority).  XXp1 will block on join(), which will cause main() to wake up and report the spork() results - after which the XXp2 processes will run.
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: Manually switching to XXp1()
XXp1(): started
XXp1(): arg = 'XXp1'
XXp1(): executing spork of first child
XXp1(): spork of first child returned pid = 4
XXp1(): executing spork of second child
XXp1(): spork of second child returned pid = 5
XXp1(): performing first join
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: Manually switching to testcase_main(), since XXp1 has created its two children, which are lower priority than 
testcase_main(): after spork of child 3 -- you should not see this until after XXp1() has created both of its children, and started its first join().  However, you should see it *before* either of the children run.
testcase_main(): performing join
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: Manually switching to the first XXp2()
XXp2(): started -- you should not see this until both XXp1() and testcase_main() are blocked in join().
XXp2(): arg = 'XXp2'
XXp2(): This process will terminate immediately.
XXp1(): first join returned kidpid = 4, status = 5 -- you should see this after the first child terminates, and before the second child even starts.
XXp1(): performing second join
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: Manually switching to the second XXp2()
XXp2(): started -- you should not see this until both XXp1() and testcase_main() are blocked in join().
XXp2(): arg = 'XXp2'
XXp2(): This process will terminate immediately.
XXp1(): second join returned kidpid = 5, status = 5
testcase_main(): exit status for child 3 is 3
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: testcase_main() returned, simulation will now halt.
finish(): The simulation is now terminating.

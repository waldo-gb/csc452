Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: init() manually switching to PID 1.
phase2_start_service_processes() called -- currently a NOP
phase3_start_service_processes() called -- currently a NOP
phase4_start_service_processes() called -- currently a NOP
phase5_start_service_processes() called -- currently a NOP
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: init() manually switching to testcase_main() after using spork() to create it.
testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: Create XXp1, which will create its own child, XXp2.  Each parent will join() with its child.  And the children will always be higher priority than the parent (in this testcase).
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: Manually switching to XXp1()
XXp1(): started
XXp1(): arg = 'XXp1'
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: Manually switching to XXp2()
XXp2(): started
XXp2(): arg = 'XXp2'
XXp1(): after spork of child 4
XXp1(): exit status for child 4 is 5
testcase_main(): after spork of child 3
testcase_main(): exit status for child 3 is 3
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: testcase_main() returned, simulation will now halt.
finish(): The simulation is now terminating.

Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: init() manually switching to testcase_main() after using spork() to create it.
testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: The simulation should be terminated as soon as spork() is called, since we are not in kernel mode.
ERROR: Someone attempted to call spork while in user mode!
finish(): The simulation is now terminating.

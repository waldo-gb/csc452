Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: init() manually switching to testcase_main() after using spork() to create it.
testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: The simulation should be terminated as soon as spork() is called, since we are not in kernel mode.
ERROR: It looks like you are running testcase_main() with interrupts disabled, instead of enabled.  Fix that!
finish(): The simulation is now terminating.

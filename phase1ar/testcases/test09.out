Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: init() manually switching to PID 1.

Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: init() manually switching to testcase_main() after using spork() to create it.
testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: The simulation should be terminated as soon as quit() is called, since we are not in kernel mode.
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: Manually switching to XXp1()
XXp1(): started
XXp1(): arg = 'XXp1'
ERROR: Someone attempted to call quit_phase_1a while in user mode!
finish(): The simulation is now terminating.
